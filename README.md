### sklearn-experiments

I tried to explore the following topics of machine learning:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Testing the APIs provided by ```sklearn```, ```pandas``` and ```matplotlib```

### keras-experiments

* CNN, RNN and LSTM
* Autoencoders and GAN
* Transfer Learning
* Testing the Layers and Models APIs of ```keras```

### tensorflow-experiments

* CNN using ```tf.keras```
* CNN using only ```tf```
* Regression using only tensors
* Testing the APIs of tensorflow
(e.g. - ```tf.constant```, ```tf.Variable```, ```tf.GradientTape``` etc.)
